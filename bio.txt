As a presenter
Hello everyone, my name is Jeffrey Chau. I was born and raised in Washington from an 1st generation household. I have an older brother and younger sister, making me the middle child. I have family all over the world because the Chau family tree is very ancient. However closest family is from California and Washington. My family is traditional, and I was raised to always respect my elders.  Every time I enter a household, I am required to greet everyone. Family reunions would be me searching for each one for 30 minutes. I think of the workplace as a household where I need to show respect and listen to my superiors. I hope to be able to greet everyone, thank you for your time.
