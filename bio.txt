Greetings everyone, my name is Jeffrey Chau and I am a proud Chinese and Vietnamese descent. I am an first generation American born and raised in Washington state. Being a first generation, I was taught a lot about my culture from both Vietnam and China. I appreciate my previous generations for granting me the opportunity to live in the US. I value my elders because that is what I was taught when I was younger. I hope to be able to meet everyone while I pursue an career in technology.
